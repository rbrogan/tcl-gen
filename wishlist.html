<p><i>Do you want to know what else is there on the horizon (besides the <a href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>)?</i> You can check the following for features we will be trying to add in the future. Some of these may come as early as the next release.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Number</th><th>Title</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>Installer / Configurator</td><td>An installer .exe with screens that allow you to configure the package to have commands, namespaces, etc. that you desire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>Strictness/Permissiveness Policies, Warnings</td><td>You can decide what inputs will be silently accepted vs. generate warnings or errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>DetectCase</td><td>Tell what case (e.g. PascalCase, snake_case) the given string is in. This will also simplify the ChangeCasing command.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>Auto Reload</td><td>A terminal mode which checks whether files in a package have been modified, and if so, it will auto-reload the package.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td><td>Support for TEPAM / Support for flags</td><td>There are a number of features from TEPAM we want, especially support for flags. For many commands it is awkward to go without flags. We also may want TEPAM support for validation / error reporting since for many commands that is taking up a fair amount of code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td><td>Exception Policies</td><td>This also sticks out when writing many commands. Should we silently change an index out-of-bounds to be the end index (as some commands do)? Should we raise an error? At this point, the choice feels too arbitrary. We would rather have a basic set of default policies and give the user the ability to override and make them be consistent with their own policies.</td>
