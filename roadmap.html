<p>For the next release, we will do another handful of datetime commands. As far as features go, we may introduce some namespace-related elements as part of a versioning strategy and perhaps may tweak the Partial Loading feature a bit, particularly support for detecting the version of Tcl used and the versions of packages.</p>
<p>
At this point, we will most likely go on for a time with monthly releases which include both a modest assortment of commands to keep things moving, as well as infrastructure development.
