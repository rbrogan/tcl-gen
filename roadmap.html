<p>These next months will be a transition period for the Gen project. Originally, the project came from writing utilities while in the process of working on other projects.</p>
<p>That backlog of commands has been gone through. For the next phase of Gen, we would like to build it out with a series of infrastructure improvements that lead up to making Gen an open community project that anyone can easily contribute to. Think of the code snippets sprinkled throughout wiki.tcl.tk, but with documentation and tests, and organized into a package (or packages).</p>
<p>If possible, we would like to first post up the designs and open it up for anyone to get involved, if they like.</p>
<p>To know when the date for the next release is determined, please follow the instructions below to subscribe to the mailing list.</p>
