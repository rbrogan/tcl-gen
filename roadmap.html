<p>We hope to do a series of small releases (hopefully one every two weeks). Each release would consist of both a modest installment of commands as well as project improvements. Our main goal here from a project management POV is to keep things moving with commitments to hard dates and have those drive project improvements.

<p>In this release we will put out FTP commands for uploading, and possibly a few other assorted commands as well.</p>
<p>We will also try, if possible, to make it possible to load Gen without loading every package used. So, if you do not use FTP commands then the FTP package would not have to be loaded.</p>
