For this release we have five commands, which I, personally, have wanted to
have for some time. They are convenience commands which you would avoid writing
because they seem too simple and yet just when you need them, they are a touch
troublesome to have to switch gears and work out.

IncludeExcludeListFilter
     Return list with all to be included, none to be excluded.
