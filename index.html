<p>Say you are in the middle of solving one problem and find you need to solve another. Suppose you need to write the contents of a string to a file. You could look up how to do this, but it would be nice and <i>convenient</i> if there were something that does it all for you with one command.</p>

<p>Gen is about making it a little bit easier to write Tcl programs. Gen is supposed to be code that you could well write yourself but do not want to have to.</p>
