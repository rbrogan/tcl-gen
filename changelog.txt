v1.1

No changes break existing command usage.

By functionality
. Monthly release of new commands, with corresponding files in test and doc directories.
. @ designator support: Several existing commands have been updated to allow passing in the name of an in/out variable instead of a value. This should not affect existing usage.
. Decr now supports taking an integer value as a second argument, which makes it more consistent with incr.
. Updated test generator code (not included) and so tests have changed in format.
. Added this CHANGELOG page and a NEWS page.
