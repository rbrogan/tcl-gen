v1.7.0

The Run command has changed to save the pre-existing contents of ::argv and
restore them before exiting. It is unlikely this should break existing usage. If
this change does cause a bug then it means something somehow happened to use the
contents of ::argv that were left over from a call to Run. This is pretty
unlikely.

Changes by functionality

    Monthly release of new commands, with corresponding files in test and doc
directories.

No changes break existing command usage.

By functionality
. Monthly release of new commands, with corresponding files in test and doc
directories.
. @ designator support: Several existing commands have been updated to allow
passing in the name of an in/out variable instead of a value. This should not
affect existing usage.
. Decr now supports taking an integer value as a second argument, which makes it
more consistent with incr.
. Updated test generator code (not included) and so tests have changed in
format.
. Added this CHANGELOG page and a NEWS page.
