---01| HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

What is the point of these tests? What are they for? What do they accomplish?
See INTRO.

How can I find out what files should be in this directory and what are they for?
See CATALOG.

How do I run the tests myself?
See RUNNING TESTS.

What if I find problems with the tests?
See REPORTING ISSUES.

How can I contribute back tests?
See CONTRIBUTING.

---02| INTRO

Gen includes a moderate suite of tests which double as code samples. The purpose
of the tests is not to be exhaustive and guarantee the code is perfect so much
as establish a baseline of confidence in the library. The goal of the tests is
to be able to say that if you find an error caused by the library code itself,
you are doing something out-of-the-ordinary; all the typical ways things can go
wrong, we should have checked.

Note that we do not include every possible test for the core TCL commands
invoked. For instance, we do not include tests to check whether the TCL regexp
command works correctly or to check the input you pass in to ensure it is valid
before passing it along to commands. For instance, suppose you were to enter
this --

% set MyDict [ArrangeDict {one uno two dos three} {three two one}]

-- here the dict is invalid. The ArrangeDict command does not check your input
but rather the error "missing value to go with key" will be generated by the
dict exists command, which you will see with puts $::errorInfo. So we do not
have any functionality in ArrangeDict that tries to ensure a call to dict exists
will not generate an error and we also do not have any corresponding tests.

---03| RUNNING TESTS

To run all tests from the command line:
> tclsh86 all.tcl

To run all tests from the tcl shell:
% source all.tct

To run tests for a given proc (for instance, AddTo) from the command line:
> tclsh86 addto.test

To run tests for a given proc (for instance, AddTo) from the tcl shell:
% source addto.test

---04| BUG REPORTING

If you find bugs in tests or missing tests, please let us know.

Visit http://www.robertbrogan.com/gen/feedback.html to use the form.

Alternatively, send an email to:

gen.bugreport@robertbrogan.com

and we will try to get back to you ASAP.

---05| CONTRIBUTING

Nothing formal has been set up for governing this project, yet.

If you like, you may change the test code yourself or write a new test and
submit a patch to:

gen.bugreport@robertbrogan.com (for bug fixes)
-or-
gen.wishlist@robertbrogan.com (for tests you implemented)

A roadmap (scheduled changes) and wishlist (not yet scheduled) are available at:

http://www.robertbrogan.com/gen/roadmap.html
