<h1>About Partial Loading</h1>
<p>
Gen is meant to be a utility library that anyone can use. It is a bit problematic to require someone to have every package that every Gen command uses, especially if you want Gen only for certain commands. If Gen is about convenience commands, then it should grow over time to include many commands across many packages. But as it does that and its usefulness goes up, its usability goes down because it puts extra burden on you to find and install many packages. This is a problem we would like to solve.
</p>
<p>
The solution we are moving towards is to have Gen try to load what it can based on what the you have available at load-time. If a command needs a missing package then that command will not load, but still the Gen library will load. If you do not need that command, then you do not need to bother with getting the package.
</p>
<p>
It is expected that this feature will need to evolve out over time.
</p>
<p>
As of the current release, you will not see any apparent changes when you load Gen. If you go to use a command that was not loaded, it will throw an error saying the command was not successfully loaded because a certain dependency was missing. This is not so different from trying to use the command and having it complain that the command was not found. But it is better in that it will tell you what package you need to get.
</p>
<p>
But suppose you want to know what commands are not being loaded right away? There you can do <code>set GenNS::WarnOnFailureToLoadCommand 1</code> within <code>gen-config.tcl</code>, and when you load Gen it will print out a warning for each command that failed to load and it will tell you what packages that were missing which caused it to fail to load.
