<h1>About Using @</h1>
<p>It can be tedious to write code like this:<br>
<code>set MyVariable [SomeCommand $MyVariable]</code></p>
<p>By using the @ designator, you mark an argument as the name of an in/out variable. An in/out variable both gives input and takes output. This simplifies, for example, the above code to this:<br>
<code>SomeCommand @MyVariable</code><br>
<code>MyVariable</code> has been modified.</p>
<p>
When can you use @? If you see an argument named XxxVariable (e.g. ListVariable, StringVariable, etc.) in the documentation then you can use @ for that argument. Arguments of the form XxxVariable can take <i>either</i> a normal value <i>or</i> the name of a variable to read/write, prefixed by @.
</p>
<p>For example, take the command <code>DoubleChop</code>. It has an argument <code>StringVariable</code>. That means you can pass in either the name of a variable or a value. You can do both: <br>
<code>% puts [DoubleChop "{something}"]<br>
something</code><br>
... and you can do ...<br>
<code>set MyVar "{something}"<br>
DoubleChop @MyVar<br>
puts $MyVar<br>
something</code><br>
</p>
<p>Note that currently all commands where you can use @ will also return the value of the modified variable as well. However, this is not a guarantee for the future since there may be instances with multiple in/out variables or we may want to use a return code, etc. For now, it is best to think of the @ designator as an experimental bonus feature that adds convenience to some commands.</p>
<p>Currently there is not anything set up for a situation where (1) there is an argument of the form <code>@xxx</code> and (2) the command code treats that as an in/out variable name but (3) the caller intends for it to be a normal value. In other words, there is currently no way to escape @ if you need to. We will address that in the near future.</p>
