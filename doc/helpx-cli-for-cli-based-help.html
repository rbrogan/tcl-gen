<h1>helpx-cli for CLI-based Help</h1>
<p>
<i>Want to get help info while at your CLI?</i> You can access the same help information that is in this manual by installing <a href='http://www.robertbrogan.com/helpx'>helpx-cli</a>. You can get a <a href='http://www.robertbrogan.com/helpx/download.html'>download package</a> in <b>.zip</b> or <b>.tar.gz</b> format or you can use the git repo at <a href='https://www.github.com/rbrogan/tcl-helpx'>GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
Once you have helpx-cli installed, Gen will automatically register its help information with helpx-cli when it loads (this should not do much to affect load time). You can then query that from the CLI, as shown in the following example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
% package require gen
1.4
% # Gen will have found help-cli and registered its documentation database with it.
